        <h3>Degrees of Deception</h3>

        <p>They said the future was written in code,
            <br>
            A golden road where fortunes flowed.
            <br>
            STEM was the key, the promised land,
            <br>
            But the lock was rigged, the deck pre-planned.
        </p>

        <p>Flooded the gates with dreams so bright,
            <br>
            Told us there’d be an endless fight,
            <br>
            For talent, for minds, for what we’d bring,
            <br>
            But the truth was hidden: a puppet’s string.
        </p>

        <p>They built the glut to make us fall,
            <br>
            Cheap labor, endless, at their call.
            <br>
            Degrees in hand, we walk the line,
            <br>
            But the feast was theirs, and the scraps were mine.
        </p>

        <p>Degrees of deception, sold as gold,
            <br>
            A market flooded, the lie retold.
            <br>
            Promises made, but none were kept,
            <br>
            Just a field of dreams where the workers wept.
            <br>
            We’re left to rot, cast off, betrayed,
            <br>
            By the very path we thought would save.
        </p>

        <p>An unsatiable demand, they cried,
            <br>
            But it was a ruse, a baited tide.
            <br>
            A harvest ripe, a crop to cull,
            <br>
            To pick the few, the rest to dull.
        </p>

        <p>The wage they crushed beneath their feet,
            <br>
            With surplus minds to make it cheap.
            <br>
            A pipeline built to feed their greed,
            <br>
            While we decay, unmet in need.
        </p>

        <p>The dream was hollow, a cunning ploy,
            <br>
            A million graduates to employ,
            <br>
            But only the chosen ever rise,
            <br>
            The rest discarded, modern lies.
        </p>

        <p>The conspirators laugh behind closed doors,
            <br>
            Counting profits while we’re ignored.
            <br>
            Our dreams were bait, their profits soared,
            <br>
            While we’re left broken, dreams abhorred.
        </p>

        <p>Seven years for a future denied,
            <br>
            An assembly line where hope has died.
            <br>
            The glut remains, their profits swell,
            <br>
            Welcome to the wage-slave hell.
        </p>
